# Boilerplate Chester WordPress Theme Tutorial

This tutorial explains how to create the boilerplate theme at https://github.com/markirby/Boilerplate-Chester-WordPress-Theme. 

It was designed to teach you how to easily create well structured responsive MVC WordPress themes using the Chester framework. You can also use the boilerplate as a good starting point for your themes.

If you follow the tutorial you will end up with the code available in the repository, so there is no need to clone the repo unless you want to skip ahead.

## Setup and install

### Set up a new theme

[Download and install WordPress](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress), preferably with at least one sample post and page set. The more posts you have the better you can test the site, so you could create a few example posts or use an existing site.

Create a new theme folder ready to begin.

	cd {wordpress folder}
	mkdir wp-content/themes/{wordpress theme name}

### Install Chester

Install Chester into a subfolder named Chester within a folder named lib. You could choose a different name, but we recommend lib as its a good standard.
	
	cd {wordpress folder}/wp-content/themes/{wordpress theme name}
	git clone git@github.com:markirby/Chester-WordPress-MVC-Theme-Framework.git lib/Chester
	
You could also add it as a submodule

	git submodule add git@github.com:markirby/Chester-WordPress-MVC-Theme-Framework.git lib/Chester
	
To read more about Chester, checkout the full documentation at http://markirby.github.com/Chester-WordPress-MVC-Theme-Framework/. This tutorial will cover most areas though.

### Load Chester using the functions.php file

Create a functions.php file

	touch functions.php
	
Inside this file, load the reference to Chester/require.php. This file will in turn load all the other core Chester files, setting up the framework for easy access.

	<?php 
	require_once(dirname(__FILE__).'/lib/chester/require.php');
	?>
	
### Create the style.css theme file

Create a style.css file.

	touch style.css
	
Add the details of your theme. We don't recommend adding the actual CSS here, we will instead set up some mobile first stylesheets that will work in IE6-9.

	/*
	Theme Name: Boilerplate Chester WordPress theme
	Theme URI: http://markirby.github.com/Boilerplate-Chester-WordPress-Theme/
	Description: A starting point for a MVC Chester theme
	Author: @markirby
	Version: 1.0

	For customization, please replace the above
	*/
	
### Create the basic template, index.php

Create an empty index.php file

	touch index.php
	
### Install the theme

Now you are ready to install the theme and start building real templates. Jump into http://[SITENAME]/wp-admin/themes.php and select the Boilerplate theme.

### Setup the folder structure for our controllers and templates

Chester requires certain conventions to be followed, one being the location of the controllers and templates.

We will create the default file structure
	
	mkdir mvc
	mkdir mvc/controllers
	mkdir mvc/templates

## Setup header and footer templates

We are going to take advantage of Chester's automagic loading of some common mustache templates.

### header.mustache

header.mustache is loaded first, so we will take some concepts from [HTML5Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/v4.0.1/doc/html.md) and create some good practice features.

	touch mvc/templates/header.mustache

The fields provided by Chester automatically to the header template that we will use are:

* blog_title - the page/post title and blog title
* charset - charset for the site
* template_directory - directory of the template root, used to load favicons, css, js etc

The rest are documented at http://markirby.github.com/Chester-WordPress-MVC-Theme-Framework

I'm going to add some conditional comments to identify versions of IE used, and set up the no-js default ready for when we load modernizr which will turn it to js, if js is supported.

	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<!--[if lt IE 7]>      <html class="no-js lt-ie9 lt-ie8 lt-ie7 ie6"> <![endif]-->
	<!--[if IE 7]>         <html class="no-js lt-ie9 lt-ie8 ie7"> <![endif]-->
	<!--[if IE 8]>         <html class="no-js lt-ie9 ie8"> <![endif]-->
	<!--[if gt IE 8]><!--> <html class="no-js"> <!--<![endif]-->

Here we load some more defaults, and output the title (which could contain html, hence the triple mustache)

	  <head>
	    <title>{{{blog_title}}}</title>
    
	    <meta charset="{{charset}}" />
	    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge,chrome=1">
	    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">

Favicons won't be picked up automatically from the theme by wordpress, so we specify each one, along with a template_directory variable which will contain the path to the template folder.

	    <!-- Place favicon.ico and apple-touch-icon.png in the root directory -->
	    <!-- favicons -->
	    <link rel="shortcut icon" href="{{template_directory}}/favicon.ico" />
	    <!-- For third-generation iPad with high-resolution Retina display: -->
	    <link rel="apple-touch-icon-precomposed" sizes="144x144" href="{{template_directory}}/apple-touch-icon-144x144-precomposed.png">
	    <!-- For iPhone with high-resolution Retina display: -->
	    <link rel="apple-touch-icon-precomposed" sizes="114x114" href="{{template_directory}}/apple-touch-icon-114x114-precomposed.png">
	    <!-- For first- and second-generation iPad: -->
	    <link rel="apple-touch-icon-precomposed" sizes="72x72" href="{{template_directory}}/apple-touch-icon-72x72-precomposed.png">
	    <!-- For non-Retina iPhone, iPod Touch, and Android 2.1+ devices: -->
	    <link rel="apple-touch-icon-precomposed" href="{{template_directory}}/apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png">

The stylesheets section comes next, with some settings that allow a responsive, mobile first site, which works on IE7+.

The technique below requires you have 3 stylesheets, one for the mobile first styles called global.css, then one for each further breakpoint, I've used layout-breakpoint1.css and layout-breakpoint2.css. The technique is described in more detail over at http://adactio.com/journal/4494/.

For users of IE6 we link to the universal-ie6-css created by Andy Clarke, which presents a clean linearised view for IE6 users.

		  <!-- stylesheets -->

		  <!--[if ! lte IE 6]><!-->
		    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{template_directory}}/css/global.css">
		  <!--<![endif]-->
		  <!--[if lte IE 6]>
		    <link rel="stylesheet" href="http://universal-ie6-css.googlecode.com/files/ie6.0.3.css" media="screen, projection">
		  <![endif]-->

		  <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{template_directory}}/css/layout-breakpoint1.css" media="all and (min-width: 30.625em)">
		  <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{template_directory}}/css/layout-breakpoint2.css" media="all and (min-width: 35em)">

		  <!--[if (! lte IE 6)&(lt IE 9)&(!IEMobile)]>
		    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{template_directory}}/css/layout-breakpoint1.css" media="all">
		    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{template_directory}}/css/layout-breakpoint2.css" media="all">
		  <![endif]-->
		
### header_close.mustache

We need to have the end of the header in a separate file due to the fact Chester needs to call wp_head() which echos out the content. There is no way of getting the wp_head data returned as a string, so we have to unfortunately load the two separate files.

In our header_close we are closing some tags, dropping in an IE upgrade notice for users of IE6 and showing a title.

	touch mvc/templates/header_close.mustache
	
Here is the content:

		</head>
	<body>
	  <!--[if lt IE 7]>
	      <p class="chromeframe">You are using an <strong>outdated</strong> browser. Please <a href="http://browsehappy.com/">upgrade your browser</a> or <a href="http://www.google.com/chromeframe/?redirect=true">activate Google Chrome Frame</a> to improve your experience.</p>
	  <![endif]-->
	
		{{{siteTitleHTML}}}
		
This tag {{{siteTitleHTML}}} may seem mysterious, but it is automatically passed to header_close by Chester and contains the content of the templates we will set up below.

### site_title.mustache and site_title_on_home.mustache

A best practice for good HTML structure and SEO is to have the site title inside an H1 on the homepage, but for other pages to have their main title (e.g. section title, page title, post title) as the H1. Chester allows you to specify two templates, site_title_on_home.mustache which will only be loaded if the user is on the home page, and site_title.mustache for everywhere else.

	touch mvc/templates/site_title.mustache
	touch mvc/templates/site_title_on_home.mustache
	

The fields provided by Chester automatically to the site title templates that we will use are:

* blog_name - the sites name
	
The code for site_title.mustache uses a p tag with a class so it can be styled in the same way as the h1:

	<p class="site-title"><a href="/">{{blog_name}}</a></p>

The code for site_title_on_home.mustache uses an h1 tag:

	<h1 class="site-title">{{blog_name}}</h1>

### footer.mustache

Chester automatically echos the wp_footer() command, and then we just need to load the mustache template to close off the site.

	touch mvc/templates/footer.mustache

Just a couple of closing tags needed:

	    </body>
	</html>

## Create a controller to show post previews or a post

To keep things simple we are going to create a single controller, SiteController, from which we will load data and templates to show a post, or an archive of posts. This controller can then be loaded from the various WordPress templates, which handles the routing for us.

### Setting up the Controller

Lets create the controller class.

	touch mvc/controllers/site_controller.php

The controller must extend ChesterBaseController so we can access the mustache templates.

	<?php

	class SiteController extends ChesterBaseController {


	}

	?>
	
### Add the showPostPreviews function 
	
Then inside the class we will create our function showPostPreviews.

We are fetching the post data using getWordpressPostsFromLoop(), documented over at http://markirby.github.com/Chester-WordPress-MVC-Theme-Framework/#chesterwpcoredatahelpers-wp_core_data_helpers-php/getwordpresspostsfromloop-dateformat-false

Then we render the template post_previews.mustache (which we will make next), passing in the fields posts, next_posts_link and previous_posts_link which we are creating ourselves using template tags.

	public function showPostPreviews() {

	  $posts = ChesterWPCoreDataHelpers::getWordpressPostsFromLoop();
		
		//we echo out the results of the renderPage function which outputs the content along with the header and footer
	  echo $this->renderPage('post_previews', array(
	    'posts' => $posts,
	    'next_posts_link' => get_next_posts_link(),
	    'previous_posts_link' => get_previous_posts_link()
	  ));
	}

### Create the post_previews mustache template

To display the data gathered by the previous post we need to create a template.

	touch mvc/templates/post_previews.mustache

We will then output the fields from each post, using the syntax {{#posts}} {{/posts}} to create a loop of each item found in the posts array, and then referencing the various fields from the getWordpressPostsFromLoop function.

	{{#posts}}
		<h2><a href="{{permalink}}">{{{title}}}</a></h2>
		<p>{{time}}</p>
		{{{excerpt}}}
	{{/posts}}
	
To finish off, we will use the syntax {{#next_posts_link}} {{/next_posts_link}} to show the next_posts_link only if it was found. Its slightly confusing having this syntax both loop and provide an if statement, but thats just the way mustache is. Once you get used to it, its not too challenging.

	<ul>
		{{#next_posts_link}}<li>{{{next_posts_link}}}</li>{{/next_posts_link}}
		{{#previous_posts_link}}<li>{{{previous_posts_link}}}</li>{{/previous_posts_link}}
	</ul>

### Set up index.php to load our post previews

All we need to do to load that basic code is to set up our default file, index.php.

	<?php
	//require the site controller we just created
	require_once(dirname(__FILE__).'/mvc/controllers/site_controller.php');
	
	//init the site controller
	$siteController = new SiteController();
	
	//call the showPostPreviews function
	$siteController->showPostPreviews();
  
	?>
	
Load the homepage of your site, and you will see the post previews.

### Create the single post function, template and page

Add a function to site_controller.php, this is like the first, but checks if a single post is found, and if it is, renders just that one with the field post.

	public function showPost() {
	  $posts = ChesterWPCoreDataHelpers::getWordpressPostsFromLoop();
	  if (isset($posts[0])) {
	    echo $this->renderPage('post', array(
	      'post' => $posts[0]
	    ));
	  }
	}

Create a new mustache template to display the post.

	touch mvc/templates/post.mustache

This time we will output the content instead of the excerpt, and only render a post if one is provided.

	{{#post}}
		<h1><a href="{{permalink}}">{{{title}}}</a></h1>
		<p>{{time}}</p>
		{{{content}}}
	{{/post}}
	
Create the WordPress template single.php to handle the routing.

	touch single.php
	
Then its much the same as the index.php

	<?php

	require_once(dirname(__FILE__).'/mvc/controllers/site_controller.php');

	$siteController = new SiteController();
	$siteController->showPost();
  
	?>
	
Now when you select an item in the archive the post will be displayed.

## Add tags to the boilerplate

Now we are going to add support for tags, providing a way of displaying tags in posts and post previews, and creating an archive for each tag.

Add some tags to your sample posts before we begin.

### Create a subtemplate to render tags consistently on both posts and previews

We are going to use the same html to display tags on both posts and previews. To do this we can create a template called tags, which we will include from the other templates.

	touch mvc/templates/tags.mustache

Here is the code to add. Note we use the {{has_tags}} provided by Chester to show if we have tags or not. This is documented along with all the other available variables in the [http://markirby.github.com/Chester-WordPress-MVC-Theme-Framework/#chesterwpcoredatahelpers-wp_core_data_helpers-php/getwordpresspostsfromloop-dateformat-false](Chester documentation).

	{{#has_tags}}
		<ul>
			{{#the_tags}}
			<li><a href="{{tag_link}}">{{name}}</a></li>
			{{/the_tags}}
		</ul>
	{{/has_tags}}
	
### Include the subtemplate in posts and post_previews

Using the {{> tags}} syntax we can include the tags.mustache file in our other templates.

Update post.mustache to look like the following:

	{{#post}}
		<h1><a href="{{permalink}}">{{{title}}}</a></h1>
		<p>{{time}}</p>
		{{{content}}}
		{{> tags}}
	{{/post}}

Update post_previews.mustache to look like the following:

	{{#posts}}
		<h2><a href="{{permalink}}">{{{title}}}</a></h2>
		<p>{{time}}</p>
		{{{excerpt}}}
		{{> tags}}
	{{/posts}}
	<ul>
		{{#next_posts_link}}<li>{{{next_posts_link}}}</li>{{/next_posts_link}}
		{{#previous_posts_link}}<li>{{{previous_posts_link}}}</li>{{/previous_posts_link}}
	</ul>

View your site, and you should see the tags in both places. Click on a tag to see that tags archive, rendered using the post_previews template.

## Add categories to the boilerplate

We are going to add categories in a similar way. First set your sample posts to some categories.

### Create a subtemplate to render categories consistently on both posts and previews

	touch mvc/templates/categories.mustache
	
Add the following:

	{{#has_categories}}
		<ul>
			{{#the_categories}}
			<li><a href="{{category_link}}">{{name}}</a></li>
			{{/the_categories}}
		</ul>
	{{/has_categories}}
	
### Include the subtemplate in posts and post_previews

Update post.mustache to look like the following:

	{{#post}}
		<h1><a href="{{permalink}}">{{{title}}}</a></h1>
		<p>{{time}}</p>
		{{{content}}}
		{{> tags}}
		{{> categories}}
	{{/post}}

Update post_previews.mustache to look like the following:

	{{#posts}}
		<h2><a href="{{permalink}}">{{{title}}}</a></h2>
		<p>{{time}}</p>
		{{{excerpt}}}
		{{> tags}}
		{{> categories}}
	{{/posts}}
	<ul>
		{{#next_posts_link}}<li>{{{next_posts_link}}}</li>{{/next_posts_link}}
		{{#previous_posts_link}}<li>{{{previous_posts_link}}}</li>{{/previous_posts_link}}
	</ul>

Now reload and click on a category to explore those.


## Adding some basic styles to create a responsive sidebar

Next we are going to create a sidebar to list categories, tags and pages (which we will add).

### Installing compass to help keep our css modular

I believe in keeping CSS modular and clean. I'm going to show you how to use [http://compass-style.org/](compass) to build your 3 responsive stylesheets in an easy way that works across all browsers, including IE6+, and on all mobile devices. We won't be using [http://sass-lang.com/](SASS) here, but with compass comes the ability to use SASS, so its worth looking into.

[http://compass-style.org/install/](Follow the instructions here) to install compass.

If the instructions aren't available, you basically need to install ruby and then run

	gem update --system
	gem install compass

### Install rake to allow us to easily set up the compass watch command

This will allow you easily run the script to watch your SASS folders which automatically rebuilds your CSS everytime you save a file. If you have installed compass, all you need to do is run:

	gem install rake
	
### Create your rakefile to run the compass watch command

	touch Rakefile
	
Then open it and add the following:

	desc 'Compile SCSS'
	task :compile_scss do 
	    current_location = File.dirname(__FILE__)
	    sh "compass compile --sass-dir #{current_location}/sass-css --css-dir #{current_location}/css -I #{current_location}/sass -e production"
	end

	desc 'Watch SCSS'
	task :watch_scss do 
	    current_location = File.dirname(__FILE__)
	    sh "compass watch --sass-dir #{current_location}/sass-css --css-dir #{current_location}/css -I #{current_location}/sass -e production"
	end

To remind yourself of the commands available to you, run

	rake -T
	
Once we have set up our folder structure you can run the commands with

	rake compile_scss
	
Which performs a one off compilation of SASS to CSS, or...

	rake watch_scss
	
Which will rewrite the SASS to CSS everytime you save a SASS file, until you close the terminal.

### Set up your SASS folders and files

First we will create 3 files as SASS versions of the 3 CSS files we already created. 
	
	mkdir sass-css
	touch sass-css/global.scss
	touch sass-css/layout-breakpoint1.scss
	touch sass-css/layout-breakpoint2.scss

Next we will create a file system for you to place various SASS modules. 

	mkdir sass
	mkdir sass/libs
	mkdir sass/modules
	mkdir sass/modules/grids
	mkdir sass/modules/grids/grid_two_column
	mkdir sass/libs/html5boilerplate
	touch sass/libs/html5boilerplate/normalize.scss
	touch sass/libs/html5boilerplate/main.scss
	touch sass/modules/grids/grid_two_column/grid_two_column.scss
	touch sass/modules/grids/grid_two_column/grid_two_column_breakpoint1.scss
	touch sass/modules/grids/grid_two_column/grid_two_column_breakpoint2.scss
	
### Link to these new modules from within the sass-css folder

Open sass-css/global.scss and add the following to link to the normlize.scss, main.scss and grid_two_column.scss files we just created. This will form our global.css stylesheet which will render on all browsers, regardless of width. It is our mobile first stylesheet.

	@import "libs/html5boilerplate/normalize.scss";
	@import "libs/html5boilerplate/main.scss";
	@import "modules/grids/grid_two_column/grid_two_column.scss";

Open sass-css/layout-breakpoint1.scss and link to grid_two_column_breakpoint1.scss.

	@import "modules/grids/grid_two_column/grid_two_column_breakpoint1.scss"

Open sass-css/layout-breakpoint2.scss and link to grid_two_column_breakpoint2.scss.

	@import "modules/grids/grid_two_column/grid_two_column_breakpoint2.scss"

### Add the normalize and main CSS files

To start with we will add some basic css styles from [http://html5boilerplate.com/](HTML5Boilerplate).

Open sass/libs/html5-boilerplate/normalize.scss and paste in the content from https://raw.github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/master/css/normalize.css to patch a number of bugs and get browsers working in the same way..

Open sass/libs/html5-boilerplate/main.scss and paste in the content from https://raw.github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/master/css/main.css which gives us some opinionated defaults from HTML5Boilerplate.

Our site now has some reasonable and consistent styles. As this is a boilerplate, we won't be adding any more textual styles. All that remains is to create a simple grid to hold our sidebar and main content.

### Start the rake script to run compass

Now lets build our stylesheets and listen for any other changes.

Run the following:

	rake watch_scss
	
Now, all being well, you should be able to refresh the site and see your new styles implemented.

### Notes for git users

It would now be a good idea to update your .gitignore with the following:

	.sass-cache/
	
You may also want to ignore the css files to force people to build the latest SASS. 

### Build basic grid template

We are now going to make a simple grid using 2 columns, which we can push separate content into using the templating system.

	touch mvc/templates/grids/grid_two_column.mustache
	
Now paste in the following which gives us two divs, wrapped in a container.

	<div class="grid-wrapper">
		<div class="grid-two-column--column-1">
			{{{content_block_1}}}
		</div>
		<div class="grid-two-column--column-2">
			{{{content_block_2}}}
		</div>
	</div>

### Create the sidebar

We are going to create a dummy sidebar for now with a title and some sample text.

	touch mvc/templates/sidebar.mustache
	
Paste in

	<h2>Sidebar</h2>
	<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nunc nec sem at neque mollis ornare. Fusce tincidunt nunc id mi venenatis vestibulum. Proin nec libero ut urna lacinia luctus. Vestibulum id augue arcu, vel ornare ante.</p>

### Put the main content and sidebar into the grid

Next we need update site controller so our main content is placed into content_block_1, and then echoed instead of being echoed directly.

Here is the new site controller, note how we now call render, as we don't want to include the header and footer at this point. Then we call renderPage to render the grid, as we do now want the header and footer.

	<?php

	class SiteController extends ChesterBaseController {
  
	  public function showPostPreviews() {
	    $posts = ChesterWPCoreDataHelpers::getWordpressPostsFromLoop();
    
	    $content_block_1 = $this->render('post_previews', array(
	      'posts' => $posts,
	      'next_posts_link' => get_next_posts_link(),
	      'previous_posts_link' => get_previous_posts_link()
	    ));
    
	    $content_block_2 = $this->render('sidebar');
    
	    echo $this->renderPage('grids/grid_two_column', array(
	      'content_block_1' => $content_block_1,
	      'content_block_2' => $content_block_2
	    ));
    
	  }
  
	  public function showPost() {
	    $posts = ChesterWPCoreDataHelpers::getWordpressPostsFromLoop();
	    if (isset($posts[0])) {
      
	      $content_block_1 = $this->render('post', array(
	        'post' => $posts[0]
	      ));
      
	      $content_block_2 = $this->render('sidebar');
      
	      echo $this->renderPage('grids/grid_two_column', array(
	        'content_block_1' => $content_block_1,
	        'content_block_2' => $content_block_2
	      ));
      
	    }
	  }
	}
	?>
	
### Style the grid mobile first

Lets make our mobile style first. 

Ensure you have run:

	rake watch_scss
	
Paste the following into sass/modules/grids/grid_two_column/grid_two_column.scss:

	.grid-wrapper {
	  width: 96%;
	  padding-left: 2%;
	  padding-right: 2%;
	  margin: 0 0 0 0;
	  max-width: 1140px;
	}
	
This will ensure a little padding on either side, each column will flow and there is a max-width to ensure the content works on large screens.

You will now see an issue, the page title no longer lines up with the grid. This is because it isn't in the grid. A simple fix is to wrap the site title in the header_close template with the same .grid-wrapper div. This gives you more flexibility than wrapping the whole site in a div as each block can then be moved if your design needs it.

Paste the following into mvc/templates/header_close.mustache:

	</head>
<body>
  <!--[if lt IE 7]>
      <p class="chromeframe">You are using an <strong>outdated</strong> browser. Please <a href="http://browsehappy.com/">upgrade your browser</a> or <a href="http://www.google.com/chromeframe/?redirect=true">activate Google Chrome Frame</a> to improve your experience.</p>
  <![endif]-->
	
	<div class="grid-wrapper">
		{{{siteTitleHTML}}}
	</div>
	
It should now line up.

### Set the column to shift on the first breakpoint

Paste the following into sass/modules/grids/grid_two_column/grid_two_column_breakpoint2.scss:

	.grid-two-column--column-1 {
	  float: left;
	  width: 65.666666%;
	  padding-right: 1%;
	}

	.grid-two-column--column-2 {
	  float: right;
	  width: 32.333333%;
	  padding-left: 1%;
	}
	
And thats it. If you want to adjust the breakpoints, change them in index.html to be different ems. 

You could also move the above into the first breakpoint (sass/modules/grids/grid_two_column/grid_two_column_breakpoint1.scss) and do something else in this breakpoint. Play around.

## Creating custom post types with custom fields

Chester makes it very straightforward to create custom post types, with unlimited custom fields. We are going to use it to create a sample post type named gallery for adding art galleries to our site, with the following fields:

* title
* address with field for address, field for link to a map
* a featured image
* content about the gallery
* a link the the galleries website

To do this we will update our functions.php to

	<?php 
	require_once(dirname(__FILE__).'/lib/chester/require.php');

	$galleryLocationBlock = array(
	  'name' => 'location',
		'blockTitle' => 'Gallery Location',
		'fields' => array(
			array(
				'name' => 'location',
				'labelTitle' => 'Location',
				'fieldType' => 'textField',
			),
			array(
				'name' => 'map',
				'labelTitle' => 'Link to a map',
				'fieldType' => 'textField',
			)
		)
	);

	$galleryInfoBlock = array(
	  'name' => 'other',
	  'blockTitle' => 'Other details',
	  'fields' => array(
	    array(
	      'name' => 'website',
	      'labelTitle' => 'Website address',
	      'fieldType' => 'textField'
	    )
	  )
	);

	$galleryCustomPostType = array(
		'name' => 'gallery',
		'displayName' => 'gallery',
		'pluralDisplayName' => 'galleries',
		'enablePostThumbnailSupport' => true,
		'fieldBlocks' => array($galleryLocationBlock, $galleryInfoBlock)
	);

	$adminSettings = array(
		'customPostTypes' => array($galleryCustomPostType)
	);

	$adminController = new ChesterAdminController($adminSettings);

	?>

These settings provide us with the fields we need. 

We then need to create two files:

	mkdir mvc/admin_templates
	touch mvc/admin_templates/gallery_location.php
	touch mvc/admin_templates/gallery_other.php
	
In each paste:

	<?php ChesterWPAlchemyHelpers::showFields($mb); ?>

Go ahead now and create some sample galleries.
	
## Displaying custom post types with custom fields

### Update the permalinks for readable urls

Lets fix the permalinks structure to show SEO friendly URLS - go to the admin area, select settings -> permalinks and pick the option 'Post name'. Update the .htaccess as instructed.

Go to {your site url}/galleries.

You should see the galleries you entered listed in the same style as the posts. The new fields won't show up. Imagine we want to display all these galleries with the custom fields.

### Add to the controller to handle the new fields

Open mvc/controllers/site_controller.php

Add the following new function:

	public function showGalleries() {
    $posts = ChesterWPCoreDataHelpers::getWordpressPostsFromLoop(false, array('location', 'map', 'website'));

    $content_block_1 = $this->render('galleries', array(
      'posts' => $posts
    ));
      
    $content_block_2 = $this->render('sidebar');
    
    echo $this->renderPage('grids/grid_two_column', array(
      'content_block_1' => $content_block_1,
      'content_block_2' => $content_block_2
    ));    
  }

This calls getWordpressPostsFromLoop with an array containing the names of all of the new fields we added in functions.php. This is all thats needed to pull them out. The featured image will be pulled out automatically.

### Create the new mustache template

	touch mvc/templates/galleries.mustache
	
Here is where we will load our HTML:

	<h1>Galleries</h1>
	{{#posts}}
		<h2>{{{title}}}</h2>
		{{#location}}<p>{{#map}}<a href="{{map}}">{{/map}}{{location}}{{#map}}</a>{{/map}}</p>{{/location}}
		{{#featured_image_url_medium}}<img src="{{featured_image_url_medium}}" />{{/featured_image_url_medium}}
		{{{content}}}
		{{#website}}<p><a href="{{website}}">Visit the website -></a></p>{{/website}}
	{{/posts}}
	
Note how we check conditionally if each item has been found before outputting surrounding HTML. This is a good practice to avoid lots of empty tags if people haven't fully filled out the forms.

### Create the WordPress template to route

Create a WP template file to capture this URL and route it.

	touch archive-gallery.php
	
Paste in:

	<?php

	require_once(dirname(__FILE__).'/mvc/controllers/site_controller.php');

	$siteController = new SiteController();
	$siteController->showGalleries();

	?>

This will display our galleries in the correct format.

### Display all galleries

Imagine we don't want pagination for this special type, but just want to display them all. To do this, update the showGalleries call in mvc/controllers/site_controller.php

	public function showGalleries() {
		//Set third variable to true
	  $posts = ChesterWPCoreDataHelpers::getWordpressPostsFromLoop(false, array('location', 'map', 'website'), true);

	  $content_block_1 = $this->render('galleries', array(
	    'posts' => $posts
	  ));
    
	  $content_block_2 = $this->render('sidebar');
  
	  echo $this->renderPage('grids/grid_two_column', array(
	    'content_block_1' => $content_block_1,
	    'content_block_2' => $content_block_2
	  ));    
	}
	
Setting getWordpressPostsFromLoop, $fetchAllPosts to true has the desired effect.


## Pick galleries to highlight on the home page

To conclude we will pick the latest gallery to put it on the home page in the sidebar.

### Add showHome() to the site controller

Open mvc/controllers/site_controller.php and add this function:

	public function showHome() {
	  $posts = ChesterWPCoreDataHelpers::getWordpressPostsFromLoop();
  
	  $content_block_1 = $this->render('post_previews', array(
	    'posts' => $posts,
	    'next_posts_link' => get_next_posts_link(),
	    'previous_posts_link' => get_previous_posts_link()
	  ));
      
	  $latestGallery = $this->render('galleries', array(
	    'posts' => ChesterWPCoreDataHelpers::getPosts(false, 'gallery', '1', array('location', 'map', 'website'))
	  ));
  
	  echo $this->renderPage('grids/grid_two_column', array(
	    'content_block_1' => $content_block_1,
	    'content_block_2' => $latestGallery
	  ));
	}

We use the ChesterWPCoreDataHelpers::getPosts feature, which we pass false for dateFormat, 'gallery' for post type, '1' for the number of posts we want and our custom fields.

### Add home.php

Add the WordPress template home.php to access the new function when we view the homepage.

	touch home.php
	
Paste:

	<?php

	require_once(dirname(__FILE__).'/mvc/controllers/site_controller.php');

	$siteController = new SiteController();
	$siteController->showHome();

	?>
	
## Create the pattern primer

When you start designing the site, it will be helpful to use a modular approach and assemble each piece of the site as an individual unit, bringing it together at the end, as [shown by Adactio](http://patternprimer.adactio.com/). Chester will enable you to generate a pattern primer automatically, allow you submit templates with custom data and even gives you the basic HTML you might get entered into a WordPress content field for free.

We will show you how to set one up now.

### Update the templates folder to allow automatic output of templates

We can have any number of folders of templates which don't use tags fed into Chester and spat back out as fully formed pattern primers. If that folder is called grids, and the grids contain the {{content_block_x}} tags we use, the template is automatically populated with sample content. If it has another name, it will simply output the files. We already have this set up, so it will work immediately.

For typography we can create some static templates just for the purposes of demoing how the output will look. We might have classes that we will use in other templates, but we want to isolate the design of these classes. Lets create a couple so you can see what I mean.

Lets create these:

	mkdir mvc/templates/typography
	touch mvc/templates/typography/text-1.mustache
	touch mvc/templates/typography/text-2.mustache

Then for text-1.mustache:

	<p class="text1">Text one</p>
	
For text-2.mustache:

	<p class="text2">Text two</p>
	
### Update the site controller to show the patterns

Add this function to mvc/controllers/site_controller.php:


	public function showPatternPrimer() {
	  $patternPrimerController = new ChesterPatternPrimerController();
  
	  $post = $patternPrimerController->renderPattern('post', array(
	    'post' => array(
	      'permalink' => 'http://brightonculture.co.uk',
	      'title' => 'Post title',
	      'time' => '12th Nov 2012',
	      'content' => '<p>Sample content</p>',
	    )
	  ));
  
	  $postPreview = $patternPrimerController->renderPattern('post_previews', array(
	    'posts' => array(
	      'permalink' => 'http://brightonculture.co.uk',
	      'title' => 'Post preview title',
	      'time' => '12th Nov 2012',
	      'content' => '<p>Sample content</p>',
	    )
	  ));
  
	  $patternGroup = $patternPrimerController->renderCustomPatternGroup($post . $postPreview, 'modules/');
  
	  $patternPrimerController->showPatternPrimer(array('typography', 'grids'), $patternGroup);
	}
	
We use renderPattern() to render our post and post_previews templates with some sample data.

We use renderCustomPatternGroup() to pull the patterns into a group with the name "modules/".

We call showPatternPrimer() to render the contents of typography and grids, and append our new pattern group.

### Create the pattern primer page

Now to display the pattern primer, go into the admin section of WordPress and create a page named 'pattern-primer'.

Create the WordPress template:

	touch page-pattern-primer.php
	
And link it to the new function:

	<?php
	require_once(dirname(__FILE__).'/mvc/controllers/site_controller.php');

	$siteController = new SiteController();
	$siteController->showPatternPrimer();
	?>
